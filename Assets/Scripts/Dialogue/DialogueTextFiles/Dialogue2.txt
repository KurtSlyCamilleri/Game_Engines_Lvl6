||Well...|| *You stumble upon what you first think is a corpse with how pale he is, laying in the position he was probably born in, shivering and gritting his teeth*
*You state your business and approach* ||Capital Investigator, you wear a department uniform, local DI?|| *You look over the prone man and see no sign of serious injury.* || It does not look like you need medical aid, what is the matter? ||
*The man cringes as you approach, laying further clutched up in the fetal position* ||T-T-T-They changed! They a-a-all changed! || *He whimpers softly*
You begin to prepare a note book* ||Changed? Who changed, into what? || *He does not seem to further react to you, when you notice an ID in his breast pocket, as you suspected a local department investigator, named Garroth Norn* ||Speak to me Garroth, what did you see? ||
*Garroth gasps for air when you speak his name, and a figment of sanity resurfaces on his expression* ||See? || *He turns to you and previously hidden by clothing, you suddenly notice harsh scarring from human nails on his neck. You glance at his fingers, and surely enough they are bloodied*
*He turns to face you with wide sunken eyes.* ||It starts slow...different for everyone... || *then begins to sit up as you unconsciously start taking notes.* ||As if it is in the air, it is already t-too late.. ||
||What is in the air? ||
||Too late...Too late! Too late! || *Garroth starts to shout as he continues to itch his neck, blood seeping out as he carves his own skin.
*You step back as the madman keeps shouting, agony stretching across his face.* ||Too late! Too late! Too late! TOO LATE! || *When he abruptly stands, his eyes trembling as they gaze into yours. He smiles, widely and maniacally, as he digs his fingers into his neck and tears open his own throat, releasing a splash of blood onto his jacket.* 
*Garroth gurgles, then falls to the floor choking to death, it is not long before a pool of his own blood grows around him.* ||Damn madman. || *You put away your notes and quickly try to stop the bleeding, until silently... he goes still.* ||Hah, shit. || *He is dead.*
